<h1> CSV Data: Forest Fires </h1>
	<p> 	<b>I chose to analyze data on forest fires because the general population, including me, is not entirely aware of what happens behind the scenes of a rampant forest fire. In the news, we almost never hear about the factors that contributed to the birth or growth of the wildfire -- we only learn about the death toll, the number of houses that got burned to the 1ground, or the overall damage brought on by the fire of interest. When I was looking through the CSV file, the columns labeled FFMC and ISI caught my attention. After researching the abbreviations, which I learned stood for Fine Fuel Moisture Code and Initial Spread Index, I decided that I wanted to analyze a dataset that could possibly reveal a trend between meterological conditions of a national park in Portugal and previous forest fires in that area.</b></p>

		<h2> <b>Analysis Question #1:</b> <br> Which time of the year do forest fires occur the most often? Create a bar graph that displays the number of forest fires that occur during each month of the year.</h2>

			<img src = "text1.jpg" alt="text1" class="right" width="650" height="500"/>
			</div>	
		<h2> <b>Analysis Question #2:</b> <br> How do wind, humidity, and temperature all play a role in the Initial Spread Index (ISI)? Create a graph that displays each factor's respective role in the ISI for each month and determine which factor is the greatest contributor to forest fires. </h2>

			<img src = "text2.jpg" alt="text2" class="right" width="510" height="590"/>
			</div>	
		<h2> <b>Analysis Question #3:</b> <br> Does the Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) correlate with the Initial Spread Index (ISI)? In other words, can the moisture content of litter and other fine fuels increase or decrease the expected rate of fire spread? Create a line graph that displays the FFMC levels alongside the ISI levels throughout the year. </h2>

<h1> JSON Data: Wholesale Customers </h1>
	<p> 	<b>A dataset concerning wholesale customers and their annual spendings in various regions in Portugal stood out to me because I have a family member who owns a restaurant, and often accompany them on their Restaurant Depot hauls. On these trips, I notice that the types of products we buy almost always consist of delicatessen products and frozen products, which means that they are essential in the restaurant industry. To me, a dataset that lists how much a wholesale customer spends on different types of products according to the industry they supply is interesting because I can compare and evaluate how much money other wholesale customers spend in an entirely different country, where the retail industry and the hotel/restaurant/cafe/ industry may or may not have differing customer standards.</b></p>

		<h2> <b>Analysis Question #1:</b> <br> Find the percentage of money spent on each product in Oporto. Create a pie chart that visually displays these percentages in terms of the whole. </h2>

			</div>
		<h2> <b>Analysis Question #2:</b> <br> Considering the distance between Lisbon and Oporto, and the fact that Oporto is located further outwards on the coast, which region has more wholesale customers that supply the retail industry, and which region has more wholesale customers that supply the tourist industry (through restaurants, cafes, etc)? Create a graph that compares the number of wholesale customers for each industry, in each provided region. </h2>

			</div>
		<h2> <b>Analysis Question #3:</b> <br> Which type of product dominates the others in terms of wholesale, across all regions? In other words, which subcategory of wholesale product do wholesale customers (from all the regions provided) spend the most money on annually? Create a graph that shows which category of wholesale product is the most sought after across the regions provided. </h2>
